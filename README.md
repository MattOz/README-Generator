# README-Generator

## Description
This command-line application allows users to quickly generate high-quality README files for their coding projects. 
It uses Inquirer.js as a command line interface for Node.js. This allows the user to interact with the command line though a series of prompts in which they will fill out all sections of their README file.
Once completed, a README file is generated in which the user's responses are displayed in an organized and professional way. The finished README includes links to the creator's GitHub profile, GitHub project, and email address. The table of contents allows the user to quickly access the different sections of the README file.
